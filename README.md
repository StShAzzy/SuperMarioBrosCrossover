Decompilation of Super Mario Bros 3.1.21

the things that didn't change from 3.01 to 3.1.21 are because they're literally identical, so don't bother the date difference

game from: https://explodingrabbit.com/games/super-mario-bros-crossover/

turns out i wasn't clear enough, so here's a rewrite, the game fails to launch on a standalone flash player because of security violations, the game tries to access a server on the web and store content locally, that conflicts with the default security settings, so you need to reinstall adobe's flash player somehow so the global settings panel can be opened, by accessing it you can make an exception for SMBC 3.x so it can access the webserver and store data locally also be aware this is a security concern, so be mindful of that, it's unlikely that you'll get hacked from this, but it's still possible
