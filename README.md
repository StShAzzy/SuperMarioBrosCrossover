# SuperMarioBrosCrossover
Decompile of Super Mario Bros 3.1.2

doesn't seem to load properly anymore due to an invalid internet access code, needing a local storage patch... somewhere in it's code... i couldn't find, feel free to take a look at this

there is alot of scripts yet to be decompiled and sent, i mean around 8000 i only decompiled ~2200
probably not compileable yet

game from: https://explodingrabbit.com/games/super-mario-bros-crossover/

i figured out why this didn't work, and no, it's nothing to do with it's files, it was adobe's fault all along, there's an control panel on flash player, that tells if the file has access to local or local-with-network, this game uses both so flash player throws an error about it, you can change that yourself by editing it's trusted state, setting the file to trusted state solves the problem
