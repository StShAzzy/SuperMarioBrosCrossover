# SuperMarioBrosCrossover
Decompilation of Super Mario Bros 3.1.21

game from: https://explodingrabbit.com/games/super-mario-bros-crossover/

i figured out why this didn't work, and no, it's nothing to do with it's files, it was adobe's fault all along, there's an control panel on flash player, that tells if the file has access to local or local-with-network, this game uses both so flash player throws an error about it, you can change that yourself by editing it's trusted state, setting the file to trusted state solves the problem
